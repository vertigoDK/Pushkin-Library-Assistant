---The East Kazakhstan Regional Library named after A.S. Pushkin: A Historical Overview
The East Kazakhstan Regional Library named after A.S. Pushkin was founded on March 20, 1896, by the Society for the Promotion of Popular Education. The Society comprised progressive citizens and political exiles, including O. Kostyurin, V. Gintovt-Dzevaltovsky, E. Mikhailis, I. Emelyantsev, A. Fedorov, G. Vistenius, among others. Their donations formed the library's initial collection. For example, A. Fedorov contributed 100 rubles, and the military doctor G. Vistenius donated 1500 rubles for library maintenance, selling his garden to D. Pankratiev, who committed to adding 100 rubles annually for 15 years to the library’s fund. The city administration, under public pressure, allocated 300 rubles for the library. Books from that period are stamped with "Ust-Kamenogorsk People's Paid Library with Reading Room" and "1896."
By the end of 1898, the library had 830 volumes of books and 384 volumes of periodicals, serving 428 readers. The library became a cultural hub, especially on holidays and when receiving newspapers and magazines. It surpassed other cities like Pavlodar, Semipalatinsk, and Zaysan in readership. In 1902, the library moved to the newly built People's House, now the Regional Drama Theater named after Zhambyl, thanks to the efforts of Petr Stolbov, the library's first public librarian and an active organizer of the building's construction.
By World War I in 1914, the library had around 2000 books, with a fee of 50 kopecks for use. By 1920, the collection grew to 5000 volumes, and usage became free. Pavel Petrovich Bazhov, who was appointed head of the Department of People's Education, significantly supported the library during these years. His efforts led to the library being moved to the Litvinov House, providing a new space with a reading room in the theater's round foyer until 1936.
The library was named after A.S. Pushkin on August 19, 1937, the centenary of the poet's death, by the Ust-Kamenogorsk City Council. Two years later, the library gained regional status when the Semipalatinsk Region split from the East Kazakhstan Region. In 1939, Ust-Kamenogorsk became a regional center, and the library was transformed into a regional one.
The library has moved several times since then: to the former merchant Kozhevnikov’s house on Teatralnaya Street in 1936, to a new building on M. Gorky Street in 1959, and finally, on December 29, 1983, to its current location at 102 Ushanova Street (now Kazakhstan Street).
Today, the library holds 373,916 items and serves 48,580 readers with 996,805 visits, including 567,014 virtual visits. It provides access to modern technologies, media, and internet resources, foreign literature, and a wide collection of encyclopedias, directories, and dictionaries. The library collaborates with embassies, international foundations, and organizations, positioning itself as a key cultural and informational center in East Kazakhstan.
